= USB-DAC for STM32F4 Discovery =

This is a USB-DAC device firmware implementation for STM32F4 Discovery board, using onboard DAC (Cirrus Logic CS43L22).


== Features ==

* UAC 1.0 compliant
* Low latency (about 1.5ms)
* Using "Asynchronous mode" isochronous transfer with feedback endpoint
* Master volume control support (also available in WASAPI Exclusive mode)
* Stream format supports only 44.1kHz 32bit Stereo PCM
** Due to limitation of STM32F4, the actual frame rate is 44108.07422Hz.

== Toolchain ==

* System Workbench for STM32


== Hardware modification ==

If you want to supply power from the micro-B connector, add a Schottky diode to PA9 <-> 5V on P2 pin header:

<pre>
       1S4

PA9 ---|>|--- 5V
</pre>


== LED indicators ==

=== LD3(Yellow) ===

On lighting, it indicates the analog output is activate.


=== LD4(Green) / LD5(Red) ===

These indicates the status of audio data buffer overrun / underrun. 
When the LD4 is lighting, it indicates that an underrun has occured.
When the LD5 is lighting, it indicates that an overrun has occured.
If feedback control is valid, LD4 and LD5 will turn off.


=== LD6(Blue) ===

It blinks when isochronous transfer fails during the latest 1ms (stopping, or dropping stream. The former is normal operation).
